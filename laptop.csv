"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650,15.6 inch Full HD,LED Backlit TFT LCD Anti-glare Display (45% NTSC Color Gamut, Wide Viewing Angle up to 170 Degrees, Ultra-Slim Design, 16:9 Aspect Ratio, IPS Level Panel, Mercury Free, Environment Friendly),Pre-installed Genuine Windows 10 OS.",1,54171,Flipkart,5,"Here is my review on this laptop after using for 2 weeks.I've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor."
,2,48303,Flipkart,3,"So basically, laptop is well and good. But the huge and huge and huge problem is battery. Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop. Pros - 1. Laptop performance is good (4.5) 2. Laptop display is just ok (4) 3. You will get fast boot time about 6-8 sec (4.5)  Cons -1. Worst battery (2) 2. ."
Light Laptop without Optical Disk Drive,3,48852,Flipkart,5,"Good Product, I am satisfied all of the features, except battery life, It is very awesome product, wheather have a little bits of improvement in battery life time."
Pre-installed Genuine Windows 10 OS,4,52352,Flipkart,4,"Posting this review after 8 days of usePros: Value for money          Graphics card can handle some good application          and softwares and games( far cry 5, batman Arkham          Knight) gonna install more after couple of days.

,5,50075,Amazon,5,Performance is good as I expect in this price segment they giving intel i5 10gen with 4gb nvidia 1650  there are no issue with normal use like surfing  web and it can handle some heavy application like matlab etc it's good for coding etc. If you are a heavy gamer this will not satisfy you but it suits for entry level and lite gamers. Worst battery back up it stands for 2 hours in normal usage and in heavy usage it will stands max 1 hours. But it's a value for money laptop and in this price se.
,6,54790,Flipkart,5,Amazing laptop. It has a premium and professional look with powerful hardware. Sound is a bit low but I bought external speakers for that so no problem. Everything else about the laptop easily makes up for that. Thanks alot Flipkart for the fast and safe delivery
,7,54007,Flipkart,4,"OK it's  really value for moneyfor this price it's better than MSI gf63 which is actually has the same price because it has num pad that I use very much.Look wise is so simple that I like very much.Speaker is not that bad that many people mentioned. I mean not very good but also not very badWiFi capacity is goodUSB ports are not as good as it should beCooling system works fine,  battery is the big issueand I knew it but its okay because nobody should play games with."
,8,53134,Amazon,4,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.
,9,53216,Flipkart,5,"product is good and performance is very smooth for video editings it not so good get upgrade for high graphic games handles smoothly heat management is goodbattery backup depends on work for heavy use 1hr,40min for less use 4hr for  battersaving 5hroverall expereince is very good"
,10,48496,Amazon,5,A very nice laptop with good display . Also very well performed in day to day activities as well as gaming.Definitely worth for money.  Buy it!!!
,11,51840,Flipkart,5,"Best deal in this budget üëå, boot in just fraction of seconds, really very very fast, performance wise it's best in segment, N-Vidia Graphics card along with 512ssd, makes ideal for gaming & other hevy tasks, only drawback is battery but we should understand that gaming laptop consume more power, rest of the things you will enjoy for sure. What I wants in a laptop it has all."
,12,49309,Flipkart,4,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.
,13,54504,Flipkart,5,Giving A review After 6 months Of Usage üí™BATTERY- Before Purchasing acer aspire 7 I had read That it Gives about 1 -2 hour of battery Backup. However  In my Case I am getting 3-4 Hours easily after Doing Full charge In Normal Usage(not Playing Games) . By the way You can't expect more From a gaming Laptopüòé BOOTING SPEED- It Boots In 7-10 secondsüòÅ DISPLAY- this laptop has a 15.6 inch display Which looks amazingüòèBUILD QUALITY- build Quality is average. What more you can expect From A 50.
,14,52473,Amazon,4,"This is very good laptop. I got it at 51k on the sale. performance is very good but it's battery life is about 3-4 hours but it's charger to too fast. It's design is so good, not look like a gaming laptop . It has backlit keyboard."
,15,53532,Amazon,5,"Value for Money!  Amazing Laptop I got!  It has mind blowing perfomance, It takes only 8 - 9 sec to boot ! Build Quality is also good.design is excellent ! It is completly made up of plastic but.build quality feels like it has mettalic body ! This is a quick review !"
,16,53141,Amazon,5,Got this one week before. Still got to learn so much about this pc. Very cool looking and stylish. Nice for small games. Graphic card supports many pc games. Xbox game bar is available.
,17,48577,Flipkart,5,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT:-PROS:-+Preinstalled WIN 11(not win 10 as stated)+I5 processor gives good performance in casual gaming and workspace+FOR GAMERS:- TESTED FPS{_GTA5 (70FPS)-ULTRA SETTINGS_VALORANT (150FPS)-HIGH GRAPHICS SETTINGS_RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2-(50FPS)-NORMAL SETTINGS-FORZA HORIZON 5 (60FPS)stable-Ultra settings-AC ORIGINS& VALHALLA (60+60FPS) HIGH SETTINGS}+Display is nice and crisp with the GTX 1650+Dx12+Build quality is nice(could have been better)Cons:- -Speake.
,18,52956,Amazon,4,After using 2 days -:        Perfomance - good        Battery - ok        Display -good        Build quality : could ve been better        Heating fastly while playing GTA 5 in high setting Battery in normal - 3-4 hr                  Gaming (gta 5 in very hight set) - 1-2 hrMy opinion about this lap : if you want good gaming with other works  go for this. Don't expect battery from this laptop and  build quilty is also not that great. Buy this lap when it's price is under 53k .
,19,48756,Flipkart,5,"I have fully stickered my laptop and This laptop is a beast For Gaming , Coding + 100% Good for education. Battery Backup is also good for Education gives 3 to 4 max . This Review i am doing after 1 and half month usage.  Totally I Love My Loving Laptop."
,20,52225,Amazon,5,Battery is not that good it's like kam chalao. Other part are excellent . Display is also has good colour
,21,54785,Flipkart,3,"Asus tuf with ditto same features provides 20% better performance. My friend has tuf, he gets 140 average fps with mid settings in valorant and I with aspire get 110 fps average. In case of gta 5, with mid settings tuf gives avg 80 fps and aspire gives avg 55 fps with same settings."
,22,50428,Flipkart,5,It's a beast laptop but only 1 thing I don't like is in keyboard center it gets hot n left n right side will be cool. While continues playing slowly the hotness spreads to left or right. But except hot . It's best for 12 hours gaming + steaming live.
,23,49470,Flipkart,5,"Amazing performance.Using battery saving mode, one can easily get 4hrs of battery backup.Acer care centre is also a useful thing.Make sure to debloat Norton security, it takes a chunk of RAM.I upgraded to windows 11 through installation assistant tool, then reset my PC, it's running awesome."
,24,48874,Amazon,4,No doubt laptop is good . Best laptop in budget everything is good display and performance is very good but battery and sound of laptop is not good at all max battery backup is 3 hours and the sound is very low you can't use laptop sound without speaker or earphones
,25,50939,Flipkart,4,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart"
,26,48862,Amazon,2,Iam reviewing this laptop after using one month. Good things:1 . Comparing my old laptop without graphic card and this lap performance is well2. Speed boot and faster start and shut down3. Designs and accessories okBad things:1 .  Battery backup is extremely 2hrs without game and big application iam using only virtual office like zoom meet it's dried after 2 and half hour very worst2. Camera quality very very worst like VGA camara3. File transfer is taken too long timeOverall.
,27,51341,Amazon,5,I am using this laptop from past 2 months and my overall experience is good with this product and i see lots of peoples are complaining about its battery life. I  am not sure about others products but mine is good .You can try installing NVIDIA geforce gaming drivers for better battery life . It happened with me when i installed studio drivers my battery drains with in 1 hour and after installing again gaming drivers my battery life enhance upto 4 to 5 hours on normal usage.
,28,54642,Amazon,5,"Best Laptop For Game as well as heavy work like Autocad , Solid works, CATIA and fusion 360 .Value for Money üëçüëç"
,29,51087,Flipkart,5,Best product I have ever buy .please don't buy MSI laptop as its service centers is not available and customer support is 3rd class. Acer product are much much better.   in build quality and performance
,30,52903,Flipkart,3,1. Display Brightness is medium & just ok2. No Free MS OFFICE 3. Weight of laptop : heavy 4. No bag included or any freebies just laptop & adapter is given 5. Performance is good 6. A good beginners laptop7. I would rate it 7/10  8. No other choice in market if you need a laptop with good graphics at this price range
,31,53107,Amazon,3,"Gets the work done, mid range topperPros: good battery and processor, less boot time because of ssd, good ventilation, got all the required ports, back-lit keyboard, performance was beats everything Cons: heats up too much while gaming and other intensive tasks but not on regular usage, display could be better, keyboard is very compact you need to get used to it, speakers are really low"
,32,54585,Flipkart,5,Good work and very use full and good work such prize range
,33,54670,Flipkart,4,"Pros:- Value for money- Perfect for everyday task- Good processor(i5 10th gen - 10300H) and NVMe SSD made it ultra fast.(bios time around 2.5 seconds)- Keyboard and trackpad are pretty good- RTX 1650 can handle almost all games at 1080P. GTA V can run at high(not ultra) settings,- Display is not so great but sure value for money (More than good for everyday use, if you want extra precession use a external monitor)- USB C - type enables high quality speed and display- No heating issues."
,34,52207,Amazon,4,"Nice product. Good laptop for video editing and some programmes which need quite high graphics to run. But not so good  for FHD games and programmes which really need high end specs in sense of batteries, multitasking,and constant cooling upto 2 to 3 hours."
,35,51290,Flipkart,5,Rewiew after using for 5 months .I bought this Laptop at 52k and this is the best in this price range.Graphics cardIntel IT 10th gen Good display Battery is not that good as this is gaming laptop Overall Nice experience
,36,52700,Amazon,5,Most valuable laptop in this segment.No other brand is offering this specs in under 50k.Most valuable laptop for college guys who can't afford more than 50k and trying to buy a gaming laptop.
,37,53370,Amazon,5,If you are novice and new to pc gaming industry and looking for a budget gaming laptop avoiding high end games then it will perfectly suit you temperament and requirements.For me it's a value for money laptop in this price range.Additionally if you want a battery efficient one then go for the ryzen 5 model with U series processor.Rest I can't post the photos because its not with me now but you may refer to other photos posted.Thank youüíì
,38,48019,Flipkart,5,"Worth to buy at this price range. Now I gone through all the way of my brand new acer aspire 7. Totally worth it when it comes to gaming and day to day works. But the only little bit cons is the battery, However it's better when comes to normal usage apart from gaming . May be 3- 4 hrs for normal activities which is good for Gaming laptop. I've played GTA 5 in it running at max frame rate at 1080p resolution.Surely go for this if you are student or programmer or a budget gamerüî•"
,39,48094,Amazon,5,1)Strongly recommend to those who interested to buy gaming laptop under 54k 2) I loved this laptop ‚ù£Ô∏è.3) battery backup good average upto 5 hr ( only programming)4) performance 5 üåü.
,40,51690,Flipkart,4,Flipkart delivery even before time loved it laptop has great performance display also great else I'll say after using for sometime  battery is also good
,41,51542,Flipkart,3,Overall it's awesome. But I am not happy with the battery backup. I recently downloaded Solid Works in my laptop due to that a rapid drain of power was observed without even using the software. Fully charged battery gave a backup of less than 2 hrs with normal usage. But after I uninstalled the software it started providing a backup of more than 6 hrs after a full charge. So as a gaming laptop it is expected to provide a suitable working condition for works in heavy softwares but unfortunatel.
,42,48526,Amazon,5,"Nice laptop with great features it as good speed  performance with 4gb graphics card due to this it as  a decent battery,sound not high and not low, no heating issue,data transfer, data surfing,charging also so fast.for this price this is the only laptop which comes with 4gb graphics , 5ghz clock speed more core processor"

Battery is also not bad, we get 4-5 hrs of usage for normal browsing or watching movies. But while playing games  we get only 2-3 hrs of usage. But the performance is quite good . Another important feature is the display. The display is very good."
,45,53452,Flipkart,5,Bought for 49980 during offer really worth it boots within 6 or 7 sec due to fast nvme ssd.really value for money for this laptop for coding related purpose it runs with ease. Played gta-5 in medium graphics more than playable.Advantages: performance is good                         Best laptop for this price                         Display is decentDisadvantages: Battery drains quickly within 2 to 3 hours even moderate usage but it is gaming we can't expect long battery                 .
,46,53283,Amazon,4,"After using it for about 2 weeks, I am here to give a positive review. This is totally a value for money laptop with very good specs and performance. Even the design of the laptop is quite good. If ur budget is less than 58K then this would be the best selection. It handles many games giving me good fps too. It has Wifi 6 enabling high speed wifi connectivityTalking about the negative aspect the laptop gets heated up too fast while light gaming, but I manage to keep the temp under control j."
,47,48464,Flipkart,5,Just simple lap . Not for a dedicated Gamer and editors . It's a all rounder lap for a btech students and professionals. It's display is awesome over all just love it üòç

,51,49402,Flipkart,5,"LIKED THIS PRODUCT EXTREMELY FAST AND GOOD FOR ALL PEOPLE.LIKE IF U ARE A STUDENT , OFFICE WORKER OR PART TIME GAMER .THERE ARE MANY LAPTOPS in 50k with ryzen 5 5500u and integrated graphics but this comes in 53k (only 3k more) and you get very much Higher performance. And no laptop gives dedicated graphics under 55k, so if you have tight budget of 52k-53k then no other laptop is better than this."
,52,54912,Amazon,4,So i bought it last week and this is my honest review . Battery is ok in browsing but in gaming it gives about 50 mins to max 1:30 hours .it's a beast everything is smooth overall it's good if you're looking for budget gaming laptops but if can buy the amd version of this or the Asus tuf they are better than this and faster . So recommend if you are on a 50 k budget.
,53,51997,Flipkart,4,"Pros1) Performance is excellent. 2) good display3) good viewing angles(180¬∞ rotation) 4) original windows 10 and can be upgradable to windows 11 when available.
